The entire work that we am submitting for this assignment is the group's own work and have not plagiarized it from anywhere.

Our design of the Rube Goldberg Machine is inspired by the Paul Tumeys's article on 'A Rube Goldberg Machine For Voting - Election Special'. To commemorate election day 2012 in the United States, Paul Tumeys's offered to the world an impressive screwball machine that Rube Goldberg invented for recording votes. 

This is a sarcasm on how political leaders tune the minds of the voters. Our interpretation is though different with somewhat like the three candidates as the three group members. And the voter as the teacher, who has the authority to choose the best performer in the class.

During the start of the project, since we were not well aware of the capabilities of Box2D, hence the design was a little infeasible in terms of the bird and the springs.
The function of the bird has been replaced by that of the pendulum and different dynamics have been incorporated as a substitute for the action of springs as well.
